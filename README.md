# LwjglUI
GUI library using the new and improved LWJGL 3. LwjglUI, Light Weight Java Game Library User Interface, is a graphical user interface designed to use modern OpenGL rendering techniques.

LwjglUI uses shaders and vertex buffer objects to render primitive and advanced ui elements. The ui library is very flexible allowing you to completly change how each part of the framework fits together. You have the ability to *replace* the ui element classes and or there associated rendering conterparts. 

LwjglUI is writen in Java useing the LWJGL 3 library and several other libraries including google guava, ect. LWJGL includes a wrapping of GFWL, and all of the features that come with it, including many windows running from the same jar.

LwjglUI is open sourced with currently only one developer.
